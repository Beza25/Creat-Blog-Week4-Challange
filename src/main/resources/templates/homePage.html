            When you hear "work-life balance," you probably imagine having an extremely
            productive day at work and leaving early to spend the other half of the day with friends and family.
            While this may seem ideal, it is not always possible.

            In August, we hosted a Women Who Code meetup at HubSpot and led a workshop for beginners on using git and GitHub.
            I first walked through a slide presentation on the basics and background of git and then we broke out into groups to run through a tutorial I created to simulate working on a large, collaborative project.
            We got feedback after the event that it was a helpful, hands-on introduction.

        <p>
            GitHub is an open-source repository hosting service, sort of like a cloud for code.
            It hosts your source code projects in a variety of different programming languages and keeps track of the various changes made to every iteration.
            The service is able to do this by using git, a revision control system that runs in the command line interface.

            JAVA was developed by Sun Microsystems Inc in 1991, later acquired by Oracle Corporation.
            It was developed by James Gosling and Patrick Naughton. It is a simple programming language.
            Writing, compiling and debugging a program is easy in java.  It helps to create modular programs and reusable code.

            Like everything else in software engineering, it seems, the concept of Model-View-Controller was originally invented by Smalltalk programmers.
            More specifically, it was invented by one Smalltalk programmer, Trygve Reenskaug.
            Trygve maintains a page that explains the history of MVC in his own words. He arrives at these definitions in a paper he published on December 10th, 1979:

            Stress is a physical and mental response to a threat, demand, or experience.
            It can contribute to anxiety and depression, two of the most common mental health conditions. Anxiety disorders affect 40 million US adults annually2 (ADAA), and a 2016 study estimated that 16.2 million people in the US experienced a major depressive episode in the last year3 (NIMH).
            This does not include the estimated 3-6% of the U. population who have dealt with less severe depression.4 (Sansone)
