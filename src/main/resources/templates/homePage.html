            JAVA was developed by Sun Microsystems Inc in 1991, later acquired by Oracle Corporation.
            It was developed by James Gosling and Patrick Naughton. It is a simple programming language.
            Writing, compiling and debugging a program is easy in java.  It helps to create modular programs and reusable code.

        <p>
            Like everything else in software engineering, it seems, the concept of Model-View-Controller was originally invented by Smalltalk programmers.
            More specifically, it was invented by one Smalltalk programmer, Trygve Reenskaug.

            Stress is a physical and mental response to a threat, demand, or experience.
            It can contribute to anxiety and depression, two of the most common mental health conditions. Anxiety disorders affect 40 million US adults annually2 (ADAA), and a 2016 study estimated that 16.2 million people in the US experienced a major depressive episode in the last year3 (NIMH).
            This does not include the estimated 3-6% of the U. population who have dealt with less severe depression.4 (Sansone)
